# Roberto Font's personal website

Hello! I'm Roberto Font, an applied scientist with a focus on data science and machine learning. I have led the development of several Artificial Intelligence solutions, from pure research to production. This repository contains the source code of my personal website:

[https://robertofont.github.io/](https://robertofont.github.io/)

where I have some silly fun with Artificial Intelligence, hopefully learning a few things along the way.
