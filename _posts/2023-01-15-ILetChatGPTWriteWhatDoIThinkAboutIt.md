As a blogger who writes about the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence, I have to admit, I have a bit of a love-hate relationship with ChatGPT. On one hand, it's a pretty cool system that uses the cutting-edge GPT-3 technology to understand and respond to natural language in a way that is eerily human-like. On the other hand, it's getting way too much attention and I can't help but feel a bit bitter about it.

You see, I like to think of myself as a bit of an AI hipster. I was into GPT-3 before it was cool, and I was pretty excited about the potential it had to change the way we interact with technology. But then, ChatGPT came along, and suddenly everyone and their mother was talking about it. It went viral, and I couldn't escape it. It was like the AI version of that one song that gets overplayed on the radio, and you can't stand to hear it anymore.

And I know, I know, I sound like a total grump. But, I can't help it. It's like when you discover a band before they hit it big, and you're all like "Oh, yeah, I've been listening to them for years." And then, they get popular, and suddenly everyone is a fan. You start to feel like you're part of a secret club, and then suddenly, it's not a secret club anymore. It's more like a crowded concert, and you're like "Ugh, I liked them better when they were underground."

But, the thing is, I know that ChatGPT is a good system, and I know that it has its own set of benefits. It can help businesses automate customer service and improve customer engagement. But, it's just not the same as when it was just a small group of people who knew about it. It's not the same as when it was just me and a few other AI hipsters talking about it.

And, I know that this is just how it goes. Things become popular, and they become mainstream, and that's just the way it is. But, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed that ChatGPT is getting all the attention, and GPT-3 is being overlooked. It's like the true disruptive technology here is being ignored, and it's just not fair.

In conclusion, I have to admit, I'm a bit of a grump when it comes to ChatGPT. I was into GPT-3 before it was cool, and I can't help but feel a bit bitter that it's getting all the attention. But, I know that this is just how it goes, and I'll have to learn to accept it. I'll just have to find a new underground AI technology to love, and wait for it to become the next big thing.
